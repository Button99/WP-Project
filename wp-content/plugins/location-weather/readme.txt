== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Why weather is not loading?=
Please make sure you have entered an OpenWeatherMap API key to WordPress admin under 'Settings'  'API Settings' and save it.

=Why should I use my own API Key?=
We recommend using your API key from OpenWeatherMap (weather data provider), as it will improve the overall performance of our plugin, due to a better connection with the OpenWeatherMap.org website.

The API key may require a few hours to activate. If you have recently signed up or created the API key, please be patient and try again later.
