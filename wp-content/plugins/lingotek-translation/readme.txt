Convenient cloud-based localization and translation for WordPress.

== Description ==

Lingotek Translation offers convenient cloud-based localization and translation for WordPress by simplifying the process of creating and maintaining your multilingual website. Features include machine, professional, and community translation solutions that ease the manual burden of launching in new markets while improving language consistency, cutting costs, and enabling you to deliver your brand to consumers abroad in the quickest and most effective way possible.

Make your WordPress website content truly multilingual. The power to translate is now inside WordPress!

= Customizable Translation Workflows =

WordPress administrators use Translation Profiles to categorize content by its relative value. You associate each content type with a Translation Profile, and the plugin carries out the appropriate workflow:

* __Professional__ - The plugin enables you to use your own translation agency or tap into Lingotek's marketplace of more than 5,000+ in-country translators. Don't have time to manage your own translation project? Let Lingotek take care of it for you. The plugin fully automates file transfer between Wordpress and Lingotek. You'll have full visibility into the translation process every step of the way. And once the translations are completed, they'll automatically download and publish to your website according to the preferences you've set.

* __Community__ - If you're looking to save money by avoiding professional translation, you can take the do-it-yourself approach and have your bilingual employees, partners and/or users perform translations right within Wordpress. The plugin integrates with and provides use of the Lingotek Workbench, a professional-grade text editor used for translating, reviewing, and post-editing multilingual content.

* __Free Automatic__ - Machine translation is an excellent option if you’re on a tight budget, looking for near-instant results, and are okay with less-than-perfect quality. The plugin allows you to automatically translate your site by providing the commercial API for Microsoft Translator. You can upload up to 20,000 processed words in the Lingotek system for free (we calculate processed words by multiplying the source word count by the number of requested translations). Machine translations can be post-edited at any time using the Lingotek Workbench.

= Cloud-Based Translation Management System =

Need access to an enterprise level Translation Management System designed to work directly with Wordpress and other content management systems, allowing you complete transparent access with all your translation projects? The cloud-based Lingotek Translation Management Systems helps your business access new markets and customers. Contact sales@lingotek.com for more information and pricing of these features.

= Benefits =

* Cost Savings
* Faster Translation Times
* Higher Quality
* Real-time Monitoring
* Eliminate the Copy/Paste Method of Translating
* Increased Involvement and Loyalty
* In-context Review

= Features =

Lingotek works in conjuction with the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin (the plumbing to make WordPress multilingual ready) allowing you to create a bilingual or multilingual WordPress site. You write posts, pages, and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them.

* You can use as many languages as you want. RTL language scripts are supported. WordPress languages packs are automatically downloaded and updated.
* You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, widgets...
* Custom post types, custom taxonomies, sticky posts and post formats, RSS feeds and all default WordPress widgets are supported.
* The language is either set by the content or by the language code in the url, or you can use one different subdomain or domain per language.
* Categories, post tags, and some other metas are automatically copied when adding a new post or page translation.
* A customizable language switcher is provided as a widget or in the nav menu.
* The admin interface is of course multilingual too and each user can set the WordPress admin language in its profile.
* We maintain the privacy of free automatic users by deleting all completed content from our TMS older than one month and active content older than two months. To ensure this does not affect your translated content, please download your translation soon after they are complete, or set your download settings to automatic. Enterprise customers should coordinate with client success about their community’s archive and deletion timeframes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the Lingotek plugin do? =

Lingotek has teamed up with [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) to offer a simple way to make your WordPress site truly multilingual. Manage all your multilingual content in the same site. No need to have a different site for each language!

= Why won't the plugin connect to my Lingotek account? =

The Lingotek plugin requires access to a third party API server. Your hosting provider may have a firewall in place that could be blocking those requests to outside servers. Please check with your host to allow access to Lingotek's API server. Contact support@lingotek.com for more help.

= How can I add a language? =

On the *translation dashboard,* click on the *Translate my site into...* textbox and choose from the list or start typing to quickly find a language.

= How can I remove a language? =

On the *translation dashboard,* click on the blue check mark for the language you would like to remove. *Note: if you have translated content in a language you will not be able to remove that language until that content has been deleted.*

= Why can't I upload my existing content to Lingotek? =

You must assign a language to content that existed before you installed the Polylang and Lingotek plugins. You can do this manually or use the Lingotek Language Utility to set all content that doesn't have an assigned language to the default language. This will allow you to upload your existing content to Lingotek.

= Can I use my own translation agency with Lingotek? =

Use your own translation agency or tap into Lingotek's network of more than 5,000+ in-country translators. Content transfer is fully automated between WordPress and Lingotek. You'll have full visibility into the translation process every step of the way. And once the translations are completed, they'll automatically download and publish to your website according to the preferences you've set.

= How can I check the overall translation progress of my site? =

On the *translation dashboard,* the bars under *Completed Percentage* show the translation progress of content for each language. You can filter by content type or show progress for all content.

= Why are there two different shades of blue in the progress bar? =

The *translation dashboard* not only shows how much of your content is translated, but also indicates the language that your source content was authored in.

* *Dark Blue:* Indicates that this is a source language that the content was authored in.
* *Light Blue:* Indicates that this is a target language that the content was translated into.

= What happens when I Disassociate Translations? =

When content is disassociated, the connection between WordPress and Lingotek is safely removed so that translations can be solely managed inside of WordPress.

For more, visit the [Lingotek documentation site](https://lingotek.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PDOC/WordPress).

== Screenshots ==

1. The translation dashboard allows you to view your site languages, add and remove new languages, check the overall translation progress of your site, and see site analytics.
2. Polylang and Lingotek work together seamlessly. Continue to use Polylang for content that you want to translate inside WordPress, while sending other content to be translated by Lingotek. The orange icons indicate Lingotek statuses/actions while the blue icons continue to represent Polylang actions.
3. Use translation profiles. One of the most time-consuming activities of any multilingual web-site project is managing the ongoing flow of changes and additions to site content and configurations. Translation profiles were created to allow you to create and save and re-use your translation settings.
4. Content type profiles. Manually choosing which content to upload and download is rarely what a content administrator wants to do, and automating the upload of every change is not workable because there are various types of content. Each type of translatable content can be assigned to a customizable profile. For example, by default, we like to have Posts use an Automatic profile so that content will automatically be uploaded for translation and the resulting translations automatically be downloaded back into WordPress.
5. The Lingotek Translation plugin provides the ability to Copy, Translate, and Ignore each specific custom field. Our plugin supports Wordpress custom fields and advanced custom fields.
