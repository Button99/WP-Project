== WordPress Poll maker plugin features, advantages ==

= Poll question =

There is a default **WordPress classic editor** for adding and editing the question. You can use it for formatting your question text. Most importantly, it allows you to create an *image poll, video poll or audio poll*. If you have CSS or HTML skills, you are free to write your own code and design your question the way you wish it to be. Moreover, you can insert a shortcode of any other plugin easily. This WordPress Vote plugin's developers continually do their best to build the *Best WordPress Poll Plugin* ever. All you need is to grab the chance and give it a try!

= Poll types =

This WordPress Poll plugin allows you to make 6 types of online polls:

* **Choosing** - You can add as many options for choosing as you want. There is also an option that allows users to add their custom option(Pro).
* **Rating** - With this type, you can make voting forms with rating a single product. It allows you to choose the type of rating: **with stars or with emojis**. It depends on the subject you want to examine.
* **Voting** - With this type, you can make voting forms with voting. Here are again two types: **like/dislike** or emojis. It is an easy way to understand users love your product or not.
* **Dropdown** - Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker) - You need to write the possible answers in the field of 'Answers', which are 2 by default. The participants need to choose one answer from a list of choices presented in a dropdown menu.
* **Range** - Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker) - It allows a participant to select answers in 1-100 range.
* **VS (versus)** - Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker) - This is the type of competition with two products or persons. There are awesome styles for making versus votes.

**Multivote functionality**: By selecting *Choosing* type, you can also activate *Multivote functionality*. It allows your respondents to choose more than one answer to your question. Moreover, you can give a maximum number to it, so your respondents can not vote more than the assigned count of answers to the given question.

= Notify admin by email =

With our Vote plugin, you can be notified via email each time a vote is submitted. All you need is to enable the **Results notification** by email option from your form's settings and enter your email address in the corresponding field.

= Redirection (Individual and Global) =

Redirection is a super-effective technique to **boost your website traffic**. Attract your website visitors via engaging polls and after voting, redirect them to another webpage. You can either redirect no matter the answer they give or redirect based on their answer. The latter one is a powerful **call-to-action** trick. For instance, if you are selling books, you can make a question like *What book genre is your personality?*. Then, redirect the participants to different book pages based on their answers. This a great marketing idea, isn't it?

= Schedule Poll =

Now there is wide used function: **schedule**. We also include this function in our poll builder plugin.

It saves a mass of time. For example, if you are going to make an election in the near future, you don't need to remember and set the alarm for that. You can make it right now and set a start date for displaying it.

Also, it is important to set an end date for the vote, as long as you may need to check product ratings for a **specific period of time**. The plugin will show the expiring message after the end date, which is provided from the dashboard. #1 poll plugin for WP, don't you agree?

It will display the profile pictures of those users who have taken your voting form. You can type in your preferred thank you message, for instance, *Thank you for taking the time to complete this form*. Besides, the plugin allows you to **display different result messages** based on the answer the voter chooses ([Premium feature](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker)).
